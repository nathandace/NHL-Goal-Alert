# NHL-Goal-Alert
.NET console application that will play the power play and goal song for an NHL team during a live game.

Included is the power play and goal song for the Stl Blues.  You can substitute your own teams songs as .wav files.  There is a built in delay to account for broadcast delays versus when the NHL API updates.  This can be adjusted as needed for either TV or streaming delays.
